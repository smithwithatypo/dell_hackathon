## Goal
Automate a process that matches new employees with managers of similar needs after a series of social events and surveys. <br>

## Result
My team of 6 won First Place out of 12 teams. Our solution provides better data and minimal human capital <br>

## Code Overview
1)  parse.py - parses and handles all data from multiple surveys after social events <br>
2)  Person.py - class that handles data throughout the parsing process <br>
3)  My data was sent to a Stable-Marriage Algorithm written by another intern and served on a frontend programmed by 4 additional interns.
