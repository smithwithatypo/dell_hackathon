# Overview

### This is code I wrote in 24 hour Dell Technologies Summer Intern hackathon 2022.
### My team won first place out of 12 teams.


Our goal was to automate a matching process for new-hires. 
I wrote parse.py to parse and handle all the data from many surveys.
I wrote Person.py to handle data throughout the parsing process
My output was sent to a matching algorithm written by another intern.
