# Overview

This is code I wrote in 24 hour Dell Technologies Intern Hackathon Summer 2022. <br>
My team won first place out of 12 teams.<br>
<br>
<br>
Our goal was to automate a matching process for new-hires. <br>
I wrote parse.py to parse and handle all the data from many surveys. <br>
I wrote Person.py to handle data throughout the parsing process. <br>
My output was sent to a matching algorithm written by another intern. <br>
